# Introduction

For the Genesis Interview Assignment, I build a simple React app using react-table library to display data that are being rendered, sorted, and filtered on the page.

Please note that all codes are located at src/App.js

```
https://github.com/eunjisong/Genesis_EunjiSong.git
```

2. Download the project dependencies
```
$ npm install
```



3. Start the react app
 ```
 $ npm start
 ```
